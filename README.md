# Sentiment Analysis

# Introduction
In this project, I explore English language tweets containing Putin, Lukashenka, Russia, Zelensky, Ukraine, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, or Mariupol.
The tweet data is retrieved using the Twitter Developer Platform. 

# Setup
1. Get your own token to the Twitter API at:

2. Once created, save your bearer token to a plain text file, with a .yaml extension:
BEARER_TOKEN: "replace text with your token here"

3. Decide the topics that you'd like to include. Refer to this page for filtered stream syntax:

4. Update and run the notebook
